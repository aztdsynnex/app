# Basic Application

This is a basic Python Flask front-end application created for testing purposes in an OpenShift or Kubernetes (k8s) environment. The application connects to a PostgreSQL database as a simple example to demonstrate deployment and management of applications on these platforms.

Please feel free to modify and extend this application to suit your needs. It is designed to be a starting point for more complex deployments and configurations.

No security measures have been applied to the code, so it is recommended to implement security best practices before using this application in a production environment. 

The application was created by Artem and Marcel, and we encourage contributions and improvements from the community.

For more information on how to deploy this application, please refer to the official OpenShift or Kubernetes documentation.
